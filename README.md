# Custom Enumerable Method
A mini project for The Odin project's Full Stack Ruby On Rails path Ruby Programming section where we have to rebuild several enumerable methods to get used to using yield and call. The enumerable methods that need to be rebuild and the result of the rebuild are:
- each : my_each
- each_with_index : my_each_with_index
- select : my_select
- all? : my_all?
- any? : my_any?
- none? : my_none?
- count : my_count
- map : my_map
- inject : my_inject
